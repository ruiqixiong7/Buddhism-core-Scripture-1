# Buddhism-core Scripture

## Short Description 

I want to combine the visual aesthetics of Buddhist-inspired imagery with the Liminal Space style, ncorporating dreamlike, surreal, nostalgic, and cyber-psychedelic characteristics, while also carrying a sense of heaven or distorted memory.

Through hazy, soft-focus visuals with strong filter effects, along with the visualization of text and imagery, I aim to create an interplay between reality and illusion. The images evoke a surreal atmosphere that feels “both familiar and unfamiliar,” like fragments of a dream, conveying a sense of dissociation, out-of-body experience, or drifting between parallel worlds.*

## Intent 

Recently I've read many books on Buddhism to calm my emotions. I do not believe in religion,but I find some of their concepts profoundly intriguing—embodying Eastern philosophy's transcendence and worldly wisdom, along with subtle principles for navigating life. Much Buddhist literature emphasises the immense potential within oneself, alongside detachment and clarity towards worldly affairs.

‘The sea of suffering has no shore; only self-rescue is possible.’

‘All conditioned phenomena are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows; like dewdrops and 
lightning flashes.’

They stress maintaining inner tranquillity and breaking free from attachments to cultivate the mind and preserve one's pure nature. Within their philosophy, the external factor of time is diminished and rendered vague.
Amidst the recent surge in internet aesthetics, the concept of ‘Nuclear Aesthetics’ has emerged to commemorate certain cherished aspects of the past.Through creative reinterpretations and designs of bygone elements, it evokes a longing to traverse time and revisit those bygone days. A small but growing contingent of ‘Buddhist-core’ enthusiasts has also emerged. They craft blurred, dreamlike photographs of Buddhist statues from the millennium era, fostering appreciation and understanding of this cultural tradition. This movement carries a sense of wistful longing—a yearning to preserve the simplicity of bygone eras amidst our era of rapid technological advancement.
